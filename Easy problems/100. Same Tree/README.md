# Same Tree - problem 100

Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

#### Example 1:

Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]

Output: true

#### Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].

-10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4
